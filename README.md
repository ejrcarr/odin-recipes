# odin-recipes

This current project is displaying a static webpage containing some 
favorite recipes. Once completed, it should demonstrate basic knowledge in 
HTML. Primarily, ordered and unordered lists, images, links, and the html 
boilerplate. 

At this point, I am a rising junior at Elon University with familiarity 
with Java, Python, and MySQL. Although I have some experience with HTML 
and CSS it is very limited so I plan on starting again, this 
time developing a solid foundation.
